# quarkus-spring-data-jpa-api

This is a Spring Data Jpa API only dependency. The idea is to have only the classes used by Quarkus (and the transitive dependencies)
This absolutely minimum dependencies would be a great benefit to reduce the footprint of Quarkus applications using the spring modules.
